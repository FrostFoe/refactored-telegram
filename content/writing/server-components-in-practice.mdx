React Server Components (RSCs) represent a paradigm shift in how we build web applications. By allowing components to render exclusively on the server, we can significantly reduce the amount of JavaScript shipped to the client, leading to faster initial page loads and a more responsive user experience.

In practice, this means we can fetch data directly within our components without creating separate API endpoints. This simplifies architecture and co-locates data dependencies with the components that use them. While the learning curve involves understanding the client-server boundary, the benefits—improved performance, cleaner code, and a more robust developer experience—make RSCs a powerful tool for building the next generation of web applications.
