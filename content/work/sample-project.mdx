This project involved creating a complete e-commerce platform from the ground up. The primary goal was to design a user-friendly interface that simplifies the shopping process, from product discovery to checkout.

I focused on a clean, modern aesthetic with a strong emphasis on product imagery. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
